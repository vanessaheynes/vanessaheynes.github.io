            <p>For CS 344: Human-Computer Interaction, Liam Keane, Kai Weiner and I are addressing the difficulty of navigating Carleton's music scene. 
            Specifically, we are interested in how students can better connect with other like minded individuals to explore student organizations, form bands, and enjoy music together.

            <p>After interviewing a Carleton musician, 
                I found that potential users for our app would benefit from a streamlined source to access when/where music events are held, and a platform to know who on campus would be interested in meeting other musicians. 
                For this reason, in the low fidelity prototype below, there is a page to browse events hosted by Carleton student organizations and a page to view profiles of different musicians on campus. 
            </p>

            <a href="https://www.figma.com/design/IFxV87WyrQGBCLG6cR1NPy/mid-fidelity---vanessa?node-id=0-1&t=NU78AcIROM07SKem-1">Click here to view my Figma</a>
            <br>
            <br>
            <p> My team's final three requirements for our mid-fidelity prototype include having an events board, a musicians board, and a settings page to incorporate privacy in our design. 
                The events board needs to provide users a streamlined source to stay up to date on what music events are occuring on campus. 
                Similarly, the musicians board should allow students to promote their skills such that they can find other students to play with. 
                Lastly, since we are designing a social media-esque platform, we need to consider what information students are comfortable with sharing. 
                For this reason, we consider privacy settings to be a requirement for our prototype. 
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>     My prototypes address our three requirements in the following way: The browse events page allows users to view upcoming events, and find events by campus groups. This allows users to find events on campus from a single source, rather than needing to check a variety of ones. The musicians board is set up such that users can view a list of student musicians profiles. This allows users to find other people to play music with and know about their interests/intentions. Since different users have different comfort levels, in terms of what they would like to share online, I included a settings page so that students can enable/disable what information they want to share. I believe it's important that first names and class years are always visible to promote safety/accountability, but users can choose to hide their last name, profile picture, major, and email. 
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>     In terms of our UX research process, we conducted fictional inquiry sessions to better understand our stakeholders. After getting their input on what features they would be interested in and what difficulties theyâ€™ve experienced in navigating the Carleton music scene, we were able to shape our design to fit their needs. Specifically, we learned that students only typically find out about events through word-of-mouth or posters located around campus. This indicated a strong need for a more reliable and tactical method of finding music events to attend at Carleton. 
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>     After conducting this research, our analysis process consisted of axial-coding transcripts of our fictional inquiry sessions. This allowed us to find recurring themes shared between our stakeholders and gain a better understanding of their needs. We also created an affinity diagram to represent codes from our interviews and separated them based on emotional sentiments and specifically desired features. 
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>      For my interaction flows, I chose to allow users to continue as a guest so that users do not necessarily need to have a profile in order to view events and student musicians. This aids in privacy. For the events board, there is a flow that allows users to view events by student group. I also have a navigation footer to allow users to switch between all three pages to view the events board and musicians board.
